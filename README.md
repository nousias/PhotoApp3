# PhotoApp3

This project is part of my undergraduate thesis @ Harokopio University of Athens|Department of Informatics and Telematics

The goal of the thesis was the development of a software application that would enable the user to search 
photographs based on his location as well as his orientation. Furthermore the user should be able to add 
a photograph to the public collection by uploading it to the server. As a result two web services were 
developed, the first one for handing requests that require database communication while the second one is 
in charge for file uploads. At last an end user application for mobile devices with Android operating system 
was developed which uses the sensors built in the device to extract both the location and the direction 
the user is facing and communicates with the server to make request for searching or uploading photographs.  

PhotoApp3 is the restful web service in charge of handling requests that require communication with the 
database. It was developed in Netbeans.
